# Machine Learning - Grades Prediction

This repository contains my ongoing learning journey in Machine Learning. The notebook `Grades.ipynb` is part of my exploration into supervised learning, specifically focused on **predicting student grades** based on various input features.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts a student's grade based on various factors. This is an introductory project designed to help me understand and practice the fundamentals of machine learning, including data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Description
- **Notebook Name**: `Grades.ipynb`
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Dataset**: Simulated dataset with student data.
- **Target Variable**: Student's grade (numeric value).
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Building a neural network model
  - Training and evaluation

## Learning Progress
I am currently learning the basics of machine learning, and this notebook is an experiment to apply concepts such as:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training using PyTorch
- Basic evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error)

## Future Improvements
As I continue learning, I aim to improve this project by:
- Using more advanced techniques for model evaluation
- Expanding the dataset for better accuracy
- Trying different types of machine learning models (e.g., regression, decision trees)

## How to Use
To run this notebook, simply open `Grades.ipynb` in a Jupyter notebook or a compatible environment like Google Colab. You'll need to ensure you have the necessary dependencies, such as PyTorch, installed to run the model and see predictions.
